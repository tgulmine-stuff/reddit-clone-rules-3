Review articles are prohibited unless they contain new results.\n\nReposting of existing, popular submissions is prohibited.",
      "The title and content of submissions should not be editorialized, sensationalized, or biased. All titles must adhere to our headline rules.",
      "All submissions must have been published within the past six months. This time requirement refers to the publication date of the research, not the article or web page. Ambiguous publication dates are determined by the first available date, which is typically the 'Published Online' or 'Pre-Print' date.",

      "Do not add opinion/commentary to the submission title. Don't add something that isn't covered by the article, and don't misrepresent the article. Adding a sentence from within the article that is more representative of the content is generally OK.\n\nAn article's title must not be misleading. It may be removed if the title states a source's opinion as fact, or misrepresents the facts in the article or multiple other sources.\n\nAll caps words are not allowed, except for acronyms of course.",

Dictionary.com: \"a newspaper or magazine article or report of a person, event, an aspect of a major event, or the like, often having a personal slant and written in an individual style.\"",
      "/r/worldnews is for news, rather than analysis. There are several subreddits listed at the top of the page that are good for this. If the writer injects his/her opinion in the article or tries to draw any conclusion about a set of events, then it is no longer straight news and is not permitted in /r/worldnews.",
      "This includes articles that are auto-translated.",
      "If images, videos or audio files are part of an article that's fine, but the accompanying article must have some value of its own. Merely providing image captions or video descriptions isn't sufficient.",
